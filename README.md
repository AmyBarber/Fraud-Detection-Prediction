# Fraud-Detection-Prediction

This repository contains my completed solution to the Ravelin Data Science Test. 

My work is structured across three notebooks in the notebook folder:
- 01_inital_exploration_and_feature_engineering.ipynb
  - This notebook focusses on inital exploration of the dataset, exploring the nested dataframes, and then feature engineering. The exported feature dataframe is explored in the following notebook.  
- 02_eda.ipynb
  - This notebook focusses on exploring the feature datatset to identify key trends in the data as well as which features appear most important in predicting fraud.
  - Note: due to file size, this notebook will need to be run locally to view outputs and graphs.
- 03_modelling.ipynb
  - This notebook focusses on model development and evaluation and concludes key findings as well as improvements if more time were available.

Input data `customers.json` and the exported features dataframe `customer_dataset_with_features.csv` can be found in the data folder.
